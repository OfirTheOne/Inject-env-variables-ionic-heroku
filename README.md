# The problam we targeting :
Having a web app developed in Ionic framework and [Deploying to heroku with Git](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git).<br>
I must manage at least two environments, prod(uction) and dev(elopment), and another important requirement is that no sensitive data (e.g API_URL, CLIENT_KEY) will publicly sit in the app's git repo.<br>

so .. <br>
* first, manage two envaierments, prod and dev, with different behaviors - in this case **inject different envaierment variables values in dev mode and prod mode**. <br>
* seconde, inject envaierment variable - conataininig **sensitive values** - on the heroku server **without it sitting in the repo**. <br>

we dealing with multiples framework in this process Angular, Ionic, Webpack and Heroku

# The solution :

**Handle the low level configuretion** : <br>
1. <br>
in your package.json make sure that "@ionic/app-scripts", "typescript" in the "dependencies" enrty <br>

    "dependencies" : {
        ... 
        "@ionic/app-scripts": "3.1.9", 
        "typescript": "~2.6.2" 
    } 

2. <br>
to the "scripts" entry add the following : <br>

    scripts : {
        ...
        "postinstall": "ionic-app-scripts build --prod webpack --display-error-details --config ./config/webpack.config.js",
        "ionic:build": "ionic-app-scripts build --prod"
    }

with `--prod` we set the prod flag up during the build on the server, and `webpack` configure the way that webpack will bundle our app. <br>
more on this setup [here](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts#command-line-flags) & [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#description).<br>

3. <br>
add an entry called `config` to your package.json as in the following : <br>
`
    "config" : {
        "ionic_webpack": "./config/webpack.config.js"
    }
`

<br>
**Handle the webpack configuretion** : <br>
on the root of your app (same level as node_modules) create a folder name `config`, and in it create a file name `webpack.config.js` .

the code on this file will be using [Ionic Environment Variables](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts#ionic-environment-variables), and mainlly [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) code.
