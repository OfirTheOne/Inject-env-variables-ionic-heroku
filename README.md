## The problam we targeting :
Having a web app developed in Ionic framework and [Deploying to heroku with Git](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git).<br>
I must manage at least two environments, prod(uction) and dev(elopment), and another important requirement is that no sensitive data (e.g API_URL, CLIENT_KEY) will publicly sit in the app's git repo.<br>

so .. <br>
* first, manage two envaierments, prod and dev, with different behaviors - in this case **inject different envaierment variables values in dev mode and prod mode**. <br>
* seconde, inject envaierment variable - conataininig **sensitive values** - on the heroku server **without it sitting in the repo**. <br>

we dealing with multiples framework in this process Angular, Ionic, Webpack and Heroku 
<br><br><br>

## The idea to solve this : 
we got our config data on a dev.json and prod.json (one for each env, can be more than two).
and whare ever we'll need to use our env object we'll import it from some env module,
using webpack we will make the the env object to be imported from dev.json on dev mode, and from prod.json on prod mode. Â  
on the tsconfig file in "compilerOptions" entry we can set an elias name to dir paths on our project, and webpack make it possibale for us to change the path that the alias is named from in the build process. what we'll do is in the the webpack config (that will used for the bundling of the project) we will pick the env mode we are on now (dev/prod) and set the alias to a dir path accordingly.

## The solution :

#### Handle the low level configuretion : 

**1.** <br>
in your package.json make sure that "@ionic/app-scripts", "typescript" in the "dependencies" enrty <br>

    "dependencies" : {
        ... 
        "@ionic/app-scripts": "3.1.9", 
        "typescript": "~2.6.2" 
    } 
<br>

**2.** <br>
to the "scripts" entry add the following : <br>

    scripts : {
        ...
        "postinstall": "ionic-app-scripts build --prod webpack --display-error-details --config ./config/webpack.config.js",
        "ionic:build": "ionic-app-scripts build --prod"
    }

with `--prod` we set the prod flag up during the build on the server, and `webpack` configure the way that webpack will bundle our app. <br>
more on this setup [here](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts#command-line-flags) & [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#description).<br>
<br>

**3.** <br>
add an entry called `config` to your package.json as in the following : <br>

    "config" : {
        "ionic_webpack": "./config/webpack.config.js"
    }

telling ionic to override the caustom webpack config with our webpack config. <br>
<br>

**4.** <br> 
to the tsconfig.json add the following to the `compilerOptions` entry : <br>

    "compilerOptions":  {
        "baseUrl":  "./src",
        "paths": {
            "@environment": ["environments/environment.prod"]
        }
    }
<br>

#### Handle the webpack configuretion :
on the root of your app (same level as node_modules) create a folder name `config`, and in it create a file name `webpack.config.js` .

the code on this file will be using [Ionic Environment Variables](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts#ionic-environment-variables), and mainlly [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) code.
